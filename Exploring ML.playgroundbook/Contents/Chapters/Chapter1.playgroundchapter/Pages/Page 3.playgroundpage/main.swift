# Wrap Up
So that was it! You have come to the end of the playground! Thanks for your time, I hope you had a fun experience learning about neural networks, and have a wonderful rest of your day! Hope to join you at ï£¿WWDC 2021!

 #### Open Source Libraries Used
 DL4S (Deep Learning For Swift): [https://github.com/palle-k/DL4S](https://github.com/palle-k/DL4S)

- Used for visualization of Neural Networks in this playground. I used DL4S instead of CoreML because DL4S gave me the flexibility and control to access the weights of the model and the values of each output neuron.
