# Exploring ML
*My WWDC 2021 swift student challenge submission showcasing the wonders of machine learning | Accepted âœ…*

## Try It Out!
- Download the repository and open the playgroundbook file using swift playgrounds on iPad or on macOS with teh Swift Playgrounds App to try it out!
- Or checkout the playground on [youtube](https://youtu.be/K9yRi89Ub5U) if you'd like.

### Technologies Used 
**SwiftUI**
  - display the captions to go along with the interactive Sprite Kit View
  - the interface for training and testing the MNIST neural network at the end

**Sprite Kit**
  - display, animate, and visualize neural networks
  - used for a bunch of animations such as showing the flow of data in a neural network, showing the neural network training, animating the neural network working in action, etc

[**DL4S**](https://github.com/palle-k/DL4S)
  - carry out machine learning tasks including training a model from scratch and using a trained model to predict
  - Thanks to DL4S for its flexibility and control on the ML process which allowed for access to weights and neuron activation values to be animated and showed using sprite kit.
