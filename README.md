# Exploring ML
*My WWDC 2021 swift student challenge submission showcasing the wonders of machine learning*

**Status - Submitted**

Download the repository and open the playgroundbook file using swift playgrounds on iPad or on macOS to try it out!

### Technologies Used 
**SwiftUI**
  - display the captions to go along with the interactive Sprite Kit View
  - the interface for training and testing the MNIST neural network at the end

**Sprite Kit**
  - display, animate, and visualize neural networks
  - used for a bunch of animations such as showing the flow of data in a neural network, showing the neural network training, animating the neural network working in action, etc

[**DL4S**](https://github.com/palle-k/DL4S)
  - carry out machine learning tasks including training a model from scratch and using a trained model to predict
  - Thanks to DL4S for its flexibility and control on the ML process which allowed for access to weights and neuron activation values to be animated and showed using sprite kit.
